### 02_matrix_multiply_naive.py - GPU Matrix Multiplication (Naive)

**Educational implementation** showing PyMetal API usage with a simple, unoptimized algorithm.

**Important:** NumPy will be **faster** because it uses Apple's Accelerate framework with the AMX matrix coprocessor. This demo prioritizes code clarity over performance to demonstrate API patterns.

**Key Features:**

- Simple O(N³) matrix multiplication
- Multi-buffer management
- 2D thread group dispatch
- GFLOPS calculation
- Performance comparison showing CPU advantages

**Run:**

```bash
python examples/02_matrix_multiply_naive.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
Large (512x512) @ Large (512x512):
  NumPy: 0.35 ms (766 GFLOPS)
  Metal: 6.85 ms (39 GFLOPS)
  NumPy wins - optimized Accelerate framework
```

**Why NumPy is Faster:**

- Uses Apple Accelerate BLAS (hand-tuned assembly)

### 02_matrix_multiply_optimized.py - Matrix Multiplication (Highly Optimized)

**Highly optimized implementation** with advanced GPU techniques for maximum performance.

**Key Features:**

- Bank conflict avoidance in shared memory
- Loop unrolling with `#pragma unroll`
- Optimal thread group sizing for M1 GPU
- Better instruction pipeline utilization

**Run:**

```bash
python examples/02_matrix_multiply_optimized.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
Huge (2048x2048):
  NumPy:  21.35 ms (804 GFLOPS)
  Metal:  88.08 ms (195 GFLOPS) - 2.5× slower but improving

Massive (4096x4096):
  NumPy:  158.32 ms (868 GFLOPS)
  Metal:  617.51 ms (222 GFLOPS) - Getting closer!
```

**Optimizations Applied:**

- TILE_SIZE+1 padding prevents bank conflicts
- `#pragma unroll` for better instruction pipelining
- Optimal 16×16 tile size for M1 occupancy
- ~10-20% improvement over basic tiled version

**Performance Progression:**

- Naive: ~100 GFLOPS
- Tiled: ~200 GFLOPS
- Optimized: ~220 GFLOPS

NumPy remains faster due to dedicated AMX matrix hardware, but optimized GPU shows the limits of software optimization.

#### Matrix Multiplication Performance Comparison

Comparing all three implementations on Apple M1 (4096×4096 matrices):

| Implementation | GFLOPS | Time (ms) | vs Naive | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Naive** | ~100 | ~1373 | 1.0× | Baseline - no optimization |
| **Tiled** | ~205 | ~670 | 2.0× | 16×16 shared memory tiles |
| **Optimized** | ~222 | ~618 | 2.2× | Bank conflict avoidance + unrolling |
| **NumPy/AMX** | ~868 | ~158 | 8.7× | Dedicated matrix hardware wins |

**Key Takeaways:**

- GPU optimization techniques provide 2-2.2× improvement
- Specialized hardware (AMX) is 4× faster than optimized GPU for matmul
- GPU excels at custom operations where specialized hardware doesn't exist
- ~220 GFLOPS is respectable for M1 GPU (~8% of 2.6 TFLOPS peak)

## Common Patterns

### Device Initialization

```python
import pymetal as pm
device = pm.create_system_default_device()
queue = device.new_command_queue()
```

### Compute Shader Workflow

```python
# 1. Compile shader
library = device.new_library_with_source(shader_source)
function = library.new_function("kernel_name")
pipeline = device.new_compute_pipeline_state(function)

# 2. Create buffers
buffer = device.new_buffer(size, pm.ResourceStorageModeShared)

# 3. Encode commands
cmd_buffer = queue.command_buffer()
encoder = cmd_buffer.compute_command_encoder()
encoder.set_compute_pipeline_state(pipeline)
encoder.set_buffer(buffer, 0, 0)
encoder.dispatch_threadgroups(grid_w, grid_h, 1, thread_w, thread_h, 1)
encoder.end_encoding()

# 4. Execute
cmd_buffer.commit()
cmd_buffer.wait_until_completed()
```

### Graphics Pipeline Workflow

```python
# 1. Create render targets
color_desc = pm.TextureDescriptor.texture2d_descriptor(
    pm.PixelFormat.RGBA8Unorm, width, height, False
)
color_texture = device.new_texture(color_desc)

# 2. Configure render pass
render_pass = pm.RenderPassDescriptor.render_pass_descriptor()
color_att = render_pass.color_attachment(0)
color_att.texture = color_texture
color_att.load_action = pm.LoadAction.Clear
color_att.store_action = pm.StoreAction.Store

# 3. Create pipeline
pipeline_desc = pm.RenderPipelineDescriptor.render_pipeline_descriptor()
pipeline_desc.vertex_function = vertex_func
pipeline_desc.fragment_function = fragment_func
pipeline = device.new_render_pipeline_state(pipeline_desc)

# 4. Render
cmd_buffer = queue.command_buffer()
encoder = cmd_buffer.render_command_encoder(render_pass)
encoder.set_render_pipeline_state(pipeline)
encoder.draw_primitives(pm.PrimitiveType.Triangle, 0, 3)
encoder.end_encoding()
cmd_buffer.commit()
```

### Zero-Copy NumPy Integration

```python
# Write to GPU buffer from NumPy
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=np.float32)
buffer = device.new_buffer(data.nbytes, pm.ResourceStorageModeShared)
np.copyto(np.frombuffer(buffer.contents(), dtype=np.float32), data)

# Read from GPU buffer to NumPy
result = np.frombuffer(buffer.contents(), dtype=np.float32, count=4)
```

## When to Use GPU vs CPU

### Use GPU When

- ✓ **Custom operations** not available in optimized libraries
- ✓ **Highly parallel workloads** (thousands/millions of independent operations)
- ✓ **Large datasets** (overhead is amortized)
- ✓ **Fused operations** (combining multiple steps reduces memory traffic)
- ✓ **Memory-bound operations** where parallelism helps bandwidth

### Use CPU/NumPy When

- ✓ **Standard operations** (matmul, FFT, etc.) - use Accelerate/MKL
- ✓ **Small datasets** (GPU overhead dominates)
- ✓ **Sequential algorithms** (limited parallelism)
- ✓ **Prototyping** (faster development, easier debugging)
- ✓ **Apple Silicon** has AMX coprocessor for matrix operations

### Hybrid Approach

Many real applications use **both**:

- NumPy/Accelerate for standard linear algebra
- GPU for custom kernels, image processing, simulations
- CPU for control flow, data preparation

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Shared Storage Mode** for CPU-GPU data transfer

   ```python
   buffer = device.new_buffer(size, pm.ResourceStorageModeShared)
   ```

2. **Optimize Thread Group Size** based on problem size

   ```python
   threads_per_group = min(16, device.max_threads_per_threadgroup.width)
   ```

3. **Avoid Synchronous Waits** when possible

   ```python
   # Instead of: cmd_buffer.wait_until_completed()
   # Use completion handlers or fence for async operation
   ```

4. **Batch Operations** to reduce command buffer overhead

   ```python
   # Submit multiple operations in one command buffer
   encoder.dispatch_threadgroups(...)  # Operation 1
   encoder.dispatch_threadgroups(...)  # Operation 2
   encoder.end_encoding()
   ```

## Debugging

### Enable Metal API Validation

```bash
export METAL_DEVICE_WRAPPER_TYPE=1
export MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1
python examples/01_image_blur.py
```

### Use Capture Scopes with Xcode

```python
manager = pm.shared_capture_manager()
scope = manager.new_capture_scope_with_command_queue(queue)
scope.label = "My Debug Capture"
scope.begin_scope()
# ... GPU work ...
scope.end_scope()
```

Then capture in Xcode: Product > Perform Action > Capture GPU Frame

### Check Device Capabilities

```python
device = pm.create_system_default_device()
print(f"Device: {device.name}")
print(f"Max threads per threadgroup: {device.max_threads_per_threadgroup.width}")
print(f"Supports family: {device.supports_family(pm.GPUFamilyApple8)}")
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Shader compilation fails

- Check Metal Shading Language syntax
- Ensure kernel/vertex/fragment functions are correctly declared
- Verify buffer bindings match `[[buffer(N)]]` indices

**Problem:** Results don't match expected

- Verify thread group size covers entire data range
- Check for race conditions in shared memory
- Ensure proper synchronization between passes

**Problem:** Performance is slower than expected

- Profile thread group configuration
- Check for CPU-GPU transfer bottlenecks
- Consider using Private storage mode for GPU-only data
- Batch multiple operations into single command buffer
